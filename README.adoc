== What You Will Build

You will create a MySQL database, build a Spring application, and connect it to the newly
created database.

NOTE: MySQL is licensed with the GPL, so any program binary that you distribute with it
must use the GPL, too. See the
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html[GNU General Public Licence].

== What You Need

* https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/[MySQL] version 5.6 or better. If you have Docker
installed, it might be useful to run the database as a
https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/[container].
